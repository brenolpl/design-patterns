The Observer pattern is a pattern to subscribe to the changes of an object.
Imagine that we are dealing with the current date, and every 10 seconds we want to show the date again.

To do that in each element who uses this feature, we would need to implement in every case the same code, and in some
cases, could not lead to the same values in all objects.

The observers allow us to subscribe to the same value in all objects that watch that particular data.
